<h1> Hacker News Top Stories Scraper </h1>

This is a Python script that scrapes top stories from Hacker News and filters the results based on the number of votes. Only stories with 100 or more votes are included in the output.

The script fetches the front page and the second page of Hacker News, parses the HTML, and then sorts the stories by the number of votes in descending order.

<h2> Features </h2>
